# Schedule Maker for St. John the Baptist 🇻🇦✝️

## Background
I've attended St. John's in Brooklyn, NY, my entire life, becoming a co-leader/organizer for the group of altar servers assisting the priest during Sunday Mass[^1].

Creating schedules is standard at our parish. Every Sunday, there's a list of people scheduled for mass, eliminating the need to search for last-minute volunteers, including the altar servers!📆

## The Issue
Assigning 12+ teens every Sunday has become a greater hassle. As my co-leader and I juggle full-time studies, our time to dedicate to schedules is limited. Fairness to our altar servers involves navigating rules: ⚖️
1. Altar servers shouldn't serve more than 2 Sundays in a row or more than 1 mass a day to prevent burnout.
2. On Sundays with 2 masses[^2], English and Spanish, rules clash as some kids can't understand Spanish, making serving both masses challenging.
3. Sunday Cathecism classes prevent some kids from serving the Spanish mass, as it is held at the same time as Spanish mass, complicating rule 1.
4. Every mass needs at least one appointed "leader" to handle hiccups like missing materials or technical issues.

**TLDR:** Numerous rules clash in creating fair schedules for altar servers, respecting their volunteer time.

## The Solution! 🛠️
Crafting schedules on a Google Doc isn't enjoyable. Automation became vital as I tracked altar server rotations[^3], updating numbers on a side comment. Frustration set in. "Why can't I automate this?" I thought to myself. Google Sheets could handle functions and automation, but it was more geared toward numbers and data. The irony struck—a software engineer facing technical hurdles. What if I made my own schedule creator? One doing visually what I wished Google Docs and Excel could, easing my schedule creation.

## The Goal 🎯
The primary aim is to offer a specific and tailored UI benefiting the future leaders of the ministry I currently assist. The goal is to simplify schedule creation for them. To achieve this, the tool will harness React and CSS, providing live visual cues for rule violations and helpful hints to expedite the process. As Jesus did with St. Peter, I aim to pass the 🔑's to the Kingdom of altar serving to whoever comes after me, that whatever they bound to the schedule will be bound on Sunday, and whatever they loose on the schedule will be loosed on Sunday 🤣[^4]

## The Future 🔮
The possibilities are endless. Instead of sharing a Google Doc link, encouraging altar servers to create accounts will give them instant access to schedules. The website could facilitate communication, allowing requests for replacements without intimidation[^5].🤝🔄

Even if this project doesn't meet Sunday Mass productivity goals, it's a chance for me to enhance my ReactJS skills and explore new technologies. My hopes are high, and I pray it benefits the future of this ministry!
